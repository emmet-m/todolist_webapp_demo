# Todo-list Web Application Demo
A small demonstration of a todo-list web application.

## Before you start/Prerequisites

Make sure you have `npm` installed. For this tutorial, we're using version `6.1.0`, although it shouldn't make much of a difference if you use a later version.

You can install `npm` by following [this guide](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

Make sure you also have `Node.js` installed, at least version 8.0.

You can install `Node.js` by following [this guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

This demonstration requires either a *knowledge of basic javascript* or a reasonable amount of programming experience.

## Specification

We want to define a *specification* of what the access points of our *backend server* are. This helps us:
1. Make it easier to work in teams, as we all have a common understanding of what we are building
2. Enable collaboration without directly talking to team mates (you can just refer to the spec!)
3. Increase the team's understanding of the project before you begin
4. Allow everyone to confirm that what they are intending on building is the same as the rest of the team (no miscommunication of goals)
